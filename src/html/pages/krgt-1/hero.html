				<p>The ARCH Motorcycle KRGT-1 features bespoke Ohlins / ARCH suspension front and rear, coupled with BST carbon wheels which reduce unspring mass. These elements work as part of a chassis architecture developed to deliver incredible feedback and control. An all new ARCH / Bosch ABS system is fitted as standard, working with ISR radial calipers for optimum response and safety. The 124ci S&S V-Twin engine is tuned to deliver high torque on demand with enhanced performance through a unique ARCH downdraft breathing system incorporated between the stunning billet aluminum tank halves.</p>
